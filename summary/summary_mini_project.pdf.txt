The document "BOUNDING COP NUMBER OF A GRAPH USING A NEW PARAMETER" by Suryaansh Jain and Kartheek S Tammana, under the advisorship of Professor Subrahmanyam Kalyanasundaram, explores a new bound for the cop number of a graph using a minimal subset U of vertices.

The authors introduce the game of Cops and Robbers, played on an undirected reflexive graph, where cops and a robber move along the graph's edges, with the cops winning if they occupy the same vertex as the robber. The cop number of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to guarantee a win.

The authors present their main result, showing that the cop number of a graph G is bounded by |U|/3 + 9, where U is a minimal subset of vertices such that any component of G\U has at most 2 vertices. They conjecture that this could be generalized to components of size at most k, with the cop number bounded by |U|/3 + f(k) for some function f that grows with k.

The proof involves three reduction rules that remove vertices from U and add cops to the graph. The authors then analyze the reduced graph G' and show that 7 additional cops can force the robber into a zigzag motion. By considering a retraction of the remaining graph, they prove the final bound on the cop number.

The document also discusses other attempts made by the authors, including exploring parametrized algorithms, extending the concept of dismantlable graphs, and attempting to disprove bounds of the form c(G) â‰¤ |U|/3 + k.
